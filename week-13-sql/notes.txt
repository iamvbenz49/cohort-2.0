Creating a table

CREATE TABLE users {
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
}

When working with PostgreSQL, we need to create tables with unique primary keys. PostgreSQL offers a 
powerful feature known as the SERIAL pseudo-type which simplifies generating auto-incrementing sequences 
for columns.
